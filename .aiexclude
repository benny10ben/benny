# AI Exclusion File
#
# This file specifies patterns for files and folders that the AI assistant
# should ignore. The format is the same as .gitignore.
# This is the most reliable way to prevent sensitive files from being
# included in the context sent to the AI, even if they are open.

# Environment variables and other secrets
